# ContainifyCI

Welcome to **ContainifyCI**! üöÄ

ContainifyCI is an open-source organization dedicated to simplifying the process of running containerized CI/CD pipelines. Our mission is to provide developers and teams with powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use tools to streamline their continuous integration and continuous deployment workflows.

## üéØ Vision

In today's fast-paced development environments, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) have become essential practices. However, managing and running CI/CD pipelines can be complex, especially when dealing with various environments, dependencies, and tools.

**ContainifyCI** aims to tackle this challenge by providing a suite of open-source tools and resources that make it easier to:

- **Containerize CI/CD Pipelines**: Leverage the power of containers to create isolated, consistent, and reproducible CI/CD environments.
- **Simplify Pipeline Management**: Reduce the complexity of managing and orchestrating CI/CD pipelines across different stages and environments.
- **Enhance Flexibility**: Offer customizable solutions that can be tailored to fit the specific needs of individual projects and teams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

As we are still in the **Proof of Concept (PoC)** phase, the projects under the ContainifyCI umbrella are experimental and evolving. Here are some of the key initiatives we're currently exploring:

- **Pipeline Runner**: A lightweight tool written in **Golang** for running CI/CD pipelines inside containers. Golang provides several advantages, including:
  - **Ease of Writing Tests**: Golang's robust testing framework makes it straightforward to write and maintain tests for your CI/CD pipelines.
  - **Full Dependency Management**: Golang's module system ensures that all dependencies are well-managed and versioned, leading to more reliable builds.
  - **Single Binary Execution**: The pipeline tool compiles down to a single binary, making it easy to run the pipelines consistently across different environments (local, CI/CD servers, etc.) without needing additional dependencies or runtimes.

- **Container Orchestration**: A set of scripts and tools for orchestrating the execution of containerized pipelines across different environments, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- **Plugin System**: A modular plugin system that allows users to extend the functionality of their pipelines with custom tasks, integrations, and tools. (Still in the early stages of development)

Stay tuned as we continue to refine and expand our offerings!
